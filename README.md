# Tumor-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-in-Cpp
This project was done by me as a semester project in my third year. I have used Wisconsin(Diagnostic) Dataset which has features extracted from images of Breast tumor. Applying Logistic Regression and neural networks I have predicted the malignancy of the tumor.
